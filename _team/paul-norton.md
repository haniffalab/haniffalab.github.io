A researcher with a curious mind and a strong interest in Wound healing, Immunology and Developmental biology. I am currently a Research associate in the Newcastle division of the Haniffa lab involved with projects specific to dermatology. 

Graduated with a 1st class honors degree in Medical Biology (BSc) at the University of Huddersfield. I am in the final stages of my my PhD combining the disciplines of wound healing and polymer chemistry. 

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking taking on challenges such as the Yorkshire 3 peaks, Swimming, and travelling with my partner.
