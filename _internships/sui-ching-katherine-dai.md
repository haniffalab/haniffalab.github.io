During my Placement, I looked into the clinical relevance of understanding prenatal immune development and I helped to provide scientific evidence of developmental immune programs in post-natal disease. I experienced numerous experiments, such as the use of the Bioanalyzer for assessing RNA integrity, cell culture, and nuclei isolation. This experience has taught me so much about laboratory techniques, and has taken me well beyond the school curriculum in terms of the scientific knowledge that I gained as well.
