Dr Caroline Wilson is a Newcastle University Research Fellow investigating the spatial tumour immune microenvironment for biomarker prediction using comprehensive omics techniques. She is also partaking in projects generating in vivo liver cancer models to understand if the immune system of tumours can be manipulated, preventing tumour development and spread. Within the lab, Caroline also supervises PhD students with their projects.

Caroline achieved a 1st Class Honours degree in Medical Microbiology and Immunology from Newcastle University and continued on to study a PhD in musculoskeletal research, where she researched the processing and presentation of rheumatoid arthritis joint antigen, aggrecan, by B-cells and mononuclear phagocytes. As a post-doc in the Newcastle Fibrosis Research Group, Caroline has explored the role of NF-KB subunit p50 as an inflammatory regulator of cancer and studied the effects of neutrophils in liver cancer.
