I have been at the Sanger for 18 years working in various departments on multiple projects. My interests are in exploring in vitro models of host-pathogen interactions and most recently I have worked with human Induced pluripotent stem cells and their differentiation to macrophages or organoids. I am trained to handle CL2 and CL3 pathogens and have experience in flow cytometry, Luminex multiplexed cytokine assays, confocal and high content imaging and mostly bulk RNAseq with some single cell 10x. I hope to bring some of these skills to the Haniffa projects
