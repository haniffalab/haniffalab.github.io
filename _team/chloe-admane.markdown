Chloë is a Staff PhD student/Research Assistant at Newcastle University, based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. Her research mainly focuses on understanding the role of macrophages during human fetal skin development using a stem cell-derived skin organoid model. She is particularly interested in studying the cell-cell interactions and cellular mechanisms involved in the neurovascular bundle development in human prenatal skin. She is also actively involved in 3D spatial genomics. 

Prior to joining the Haniffa lab, Chloe worked on deciphering the role of dendritic cells and adipose tissue resident T cells in HIV infection. She holds a M.Sc in immunology and a Doctorate of Pharmacy where she specialised in drug discovery.

In her spare time, Chloë enjoys reading, swimming and spend time outdoors.
