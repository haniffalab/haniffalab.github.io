The project I involved focused on testing the performance of the Human Cell Atlas API to determine the optimum Azure cloud architecture for processing large single cell RNA sequencing datasets. This involve benchmarking the performance of the application on different Azure virtual machines as the dataset size scale up. Also, suggestions has been made on possible improvements for the backend Python code for improving the API efficiencies.
