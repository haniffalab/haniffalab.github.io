During my time at the Haniffa Lab, I completed a project that involved analysing and visualising STAT3-GOF mutation data. I wrote code scripts in R-studio to analyse the differentially expressed genes data, and I used the R package FGSEA for further analysis. My background in biochemical pathways enabled me to successfully analyse the FGSEA output and generate plots displaying potential biochemical pathways that may be impacted by the mutation.
