Ben is an Academic Foundation Doctor in Newcastle Upon Tyne with a particular interest in Otolaryngology. He carried out his undergraduate medical training and intercalated degree in Clinical Anatomy at the University of Birmingham. 

He is spending his academic rotations in the laboratory and his current research focus is the microbiome of adenoid glands in children with middle ear infections, supported by a British Society of Otology small grant. 

In his spare team, he likes being outside, especially on a bike.
