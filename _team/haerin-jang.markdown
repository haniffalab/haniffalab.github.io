Haerin Jang is a PhD Candidate at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. She is interested in uncovering the pathology of immune-mediated diseases through molecular genetics and bioinformatics. She aims to understand patient heterogeneity and drug response in lupus and eczema by using single cell transcriptomic data. Her study goal is to discover molecular processes occurring within and between immune cells to effectively stratify patients for targeted drug development. She is co-supervised by Emma Davenport in the Human Genetics Department of Wellcome Sanger Institute.

Haerin received her bachelor’s and master’s degree from Yonsei University, South Korea, where she published several papers focused on the genomic and metabolomic profile of childhood allergic diseases. In her spare time, she takes long walks around Cambridge saying Hi to the ducks with a gelato in her hand.
