Stephane is a principal bioinformatician based at the Sanger Institute. He oversees the analytic work of the Haniffa group that investigates the development and functional maturation of the human cell types in the whole embryo or specific organ such as the skin, using single cell and spatial genomics.

During undergraduate studies in biology with a focus on cellular genetics and molecular biology, he developed an interest in data analysis and thus completed a PhD in bioinformatics, on genetic variants involved in bipolar affective disorder. He then gained further experience in data analysis ranging from genetics to functional genomics in medical research.

In his spare time, Stephane enjoys outdoor activities, spending time with family, and music.
