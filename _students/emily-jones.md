The project focused on testing the performance of the Human Cell Atlas API to determine the optimum Azure cloud architecture for processing large single cell RNA sequencing datasets. This involved benchmarking the performance of the application on different Azure virtual machines as the dataset size scaled up. Secondly, the project will provide suggestions on possible improvements for the backend Python code for improving the API efficiencies.
