Dr Laure Gambardella is a Senior Staff Scientist based at the Sanger Institute. She supervises the Cambridge wet part of the Haniffa Lab. There, the group runs validations and hypothesis-driven experiments suggested by the data obtained from single cell genomics. Laure is a developmental and stem cell biologist with strong experience in mouse and human embryogenesis. She has a special interest for cell differentiation and heterogeneity, skin development and angiogenesis. Her favourite skills are human pluripotent stem cell differentiation and imaging. 

Laure received her doctorate from the University Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris for studying transcription factors in epidermis and hair follicle stem cells in 1999. After several post-doctoral experiences in the UK, France and Switzerland, working on the development and function of different cell types (Hematopoietic stem cells, B lymphocytes, Endothelial cells, Neutrophils…), she joined the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute in 2014 to work on the epicardium and its potential in cardiac regeneration. Laure enjoys supervising and helping young scientists to develop. Her particular interest for epicardial cell heterogeneity made her meet the single cell genomics and she joined the Haniffa Lab in 2021. 

Out of hours, Laure is a fitness instructor. She teaches Zumba and Strong Nation® a few evenings a week.
