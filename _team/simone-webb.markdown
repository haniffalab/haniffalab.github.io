Simone Webb is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Bioinformatics and Immunology, working on analysing single cell data from human embryos as part of the Human Developmental Cell Atlas. 

Simone received her PhD from Newcastle University, and her 1st class master’s degree in Biological Sciences from University College London. She has performed computational analysis of scRNA-seq data which has been published in the Haniffa Lab’s 2019 Nature paper on fetal liver haematopoiesis. Simone is on the board of trustees for the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society in the UK and also works on equity in UK higher education through the African-Caribbean Researchers Collective. Additionally, she has helped a prospective university student through Nuffield’s Future Researcher programme.

Living by the coast, Simone enjoys walks around Northumbria exploring old castles, loves reading novels- particularly dystopic end-of-the-world types and is always looking for vinyl’s to add to her ever growing collection.
