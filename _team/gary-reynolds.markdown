My primary interests are the pathogenesis of vasculitis, in particular Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA). My focus is on the role of mononuclear phagocytes, and in particular the contribution of multinucleated giant cells that are common to this group of diseases. In my clinical role, I am an Honorary Consultant based at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle and recently contributed to the British Society of Rheumatology guidelines on the management of GCA.
