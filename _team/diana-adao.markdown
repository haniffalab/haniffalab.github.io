Diana is a Research Assistant in the Haniffa lab based at the Sanger Institute. She is involved in wet-lab projects to develop and improve the skin organoid model.
Diana has a BSc in Biology from the University of Coimbra (Portugal) and completed her MSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics at the University of Lisbon (Portugal). While doing her, MSc, Diana studied Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), looking for genomic alterations with possible value as prognosis markers.

Diana has experience in cell culture, mostly with iPSCs and iPSC-derived models. Some of her previous work consisted of generating iPSC-derived neuronal cultures to study Machado-Joseph Disease. More recently, and within the Haniffa group, Diana has been doing iPSC-derived macrophages, endothelial cells and skin organoids.

In her spare time, Diana enjoys going to the gym, trying new restaurants and socializing with friends. An everyday must-have is her wireless earbuds.
