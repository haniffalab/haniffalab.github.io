Antony is a PhD student, who investigates the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumour micro-environment using high-dimensional cytometry analysis. Through his work, he aims to improve patient stratification and inform new targets for therapy.

Antony completed his undergraduate at Newcastle University, where he graduated with a first-class honours BSc in Biomedical Sciences. His current interest in research was informed during his undergraduate by his (1) experience on a summer placement at the Centre for Life under the supervision of Prof Sayer and Dr Molinari and (2) undergraduate project supervised by Dr Wilson, where he used Hyperion to investigate HCC liver tumour at single cell resolution.

During his undergraduate, Antony particularly enjoyed his voluntary work with SOLAR, an initiative which saw him communicate science with primary, secondary and college-level students in practical and exciting ways. Antony has also been a part-time life-guard since 2015. He enjoys swimming, hiking (particularly some recent trips to the Lake District and in Northumberland), cooking and playing pool with friends. He also spends quite a lot of down-time in the gym.
