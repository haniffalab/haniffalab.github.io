During my internship at the Haniffa Lab I have worked on a project to derive a probabilistic model to define the cross-species similarities between known cell-states. I have analysed the single cell Fetal Bone Marrow dataset produced by the lab and compared it with bulk RNA-seq mouse data using pipelines in Python. This placement has allowed me to develop my coding abilities and to apply my background in mathematics to a new field, discovering that mathematical theory underpins many aspects of the tools used to process, analyse and visualise single cell data.
